> A simple website for Business

Currently, I have created web pages that look modern and reliable. I chose dark blue because blue has a non-confrontational meaning. 
As a peacemaker, blue is not meant to stir things up. Blue hates the idea of creating conflict. Companies need to make a good first impression on consumers.

## Goals

- Make a good first impression on consumers with the addition of beautiful animations
- Make clean website
- The website is made with no library or framework at all so it is very easy to customize

## Structure

- `/index.html` Entry point for the website
- `/img` All the image assets a website needs
- `/JS/app about.js` javascript for animation
- `/JS/app aplication.js` javascript for aplication section
- `/JS/app nav.js`  javascript for navigation section
- `/JS/app testimoni.js` javascript for testimoni section
- `/CSS/style navigation.css` css for spere part navigation section
- `/CSS/footer.css` css for footer section
- `/CSS/style about.css` csse part about section
- `/CSS/style ceo.css` css fort ceo section, simmple styling for tell ceo company
